1. Registered app on firebase
2. allowed it for hosting
3. npm install firebase

4. BREAK DOWN THE LAYOUT OF THE INTERFACE TO DESIGN THE STRUCTURE OF CODE Always look at the app and look for components or blocks of app separately ---> which you think will need separate reloading and create 
	their respective javascript files for react (ex. whatsapp has a sidebar and chatpannel so these will be the two files)
5. will use rfce - reactFunctionExportComponent for creating every component of the app (you can also use arror function)
6. AutoImport component in main App.js by ctrl+SpaceBar
7. Using material ui and material ui icons - good asthetic interface....google like
8. Every JSX component will have its separate css file
